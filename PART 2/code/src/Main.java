//This is what I realized while studying this assignment. I realized that this assignment was given not to improve our coding skills,
//But to understand how Design patterns are used and how they are applied to codes.
//and in order for me to do this homework, I researched design patterns both from slides and from the Internet and studied their sample use.
//That's why I wrote simple codes, but I came up with an assignment where the design patterns are clearly defined.

//Suggested Key Patterns in Homework1
// Singleton Pattern for the CityController to centralize management.
// Command Pattern for commands such as turning on/off street lights or processing payments.
// Observer Pattern to send notifications for security events or city-wide updates.
// Adapter Pattern to integrate multiple cryptocurrencies into the digital banking system.
// Template Method Pattern for automating daily routines in city services, like lighting schedules or security checks.
