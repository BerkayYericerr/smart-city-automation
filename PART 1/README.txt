## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a modular and scalable smart city system.
- Enable remote monitoring and control of infrastructure.
- Integrate digital payments for public services.
- Ensure system responsiveness using software design patterns.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Remote control of streetlights and home devices
- Security alerts and real-time notifications
- Digital banking system supporting cryptocurrency
- Centralized management of city operations
